## Getting my foot in the door

IBM was my first job as a front-end developer.
It feels like I learned everything I know from working with the amazing people at this company.

Out of all my peers from my coding bootcamp who found jobs, I was probably one of the last to get hired. I knew that I wanted to code for a living because it just felt awesome to solve problems, even better to make something that helped solve a problem for someone else. Everything else I had tried professionally felt like a deadend. Getting hired at IBM was a big deal for me and I'm very grateful that I got to do some good work there.

## Actively making my job better

I was placed on a design team focused on DevOps and I was asked to be on bi-monthly phone calls with a team working on plugins for Eclipse. Every meeting was unproductive and blocked. I walked out. I told them "We've been having the same meeting twice a month and every month we decide that no action is going to happen. I'm out."

I saw this other actual project happening at the other end of the hall.
It was a product rebranding of Bluemix (IBM Cloud) and I understood that the work coming from that effort was going to spawn a design system for this product.

I physically moved my desk from my DevOps team to the other end of the room and said, I work here now.

At least that's how I remember it.

No one told me to leave, or move my desk back.

I think my managers spoke privately about what happened and I eventually joined this other team.

Maybe a better question is, why did I stick around for as long as I did?

I'll start by saying this: I felt like I was more able to quit because now I have a portfolio piece that I'm really proud to share.

I get to say, "Hey, I worked on [Carbon Design System](http://carbondesignsystem.com/) at IBM. It's an actual thing that exists and it's out there!".

Basically, I felt like I was lucky enough to be a part of something bigger than myself and

Not only is it being used as a standard design system within IBM but it's open source, it shows up on my GitHub, I get to keep working on it if I want as a contributor and the industry has definitely acknowledged that we did a pretty good job with what we built.

I tend to fall into the trap of believing "the grass is always greener on the other side". I felt this way about work for a long time but at IBM, there was a lot happening around me that convinced me that it wasn't an ideal place for starting your career as a designer or front-end developer.
