> I worked at IBM for over 3 years and now I don't. I decided to quit very intentionally knowing that the next job I take would be harder, and possibly more problematic.

So, why did I quit?

Maybe a better question is, why did I stick around for as long as I did?

I'll start by saying this: I felt like I was more able to quit because now I have a portfolio piece that I'm really proud to share.

I get to say, "Hey, I worked on [Carbon Design System](http://carbondesignsystem.com/) at IBM. It's an actual thing that exists and it's out there!".

Not only is it being used as a standard design system within IBM but it's open source, it shows up on my GitHub, I get to keep working on it if I want as a contributor and the industry has definitely acknowledged that we did a pretty good job with what we built.

I tend to fall into the trap of believing "the grass is always greener on the other side". I felt this way about work for a long time but at IBM, there was a lot happening around me that convinced me that it wasn't an ideal place for starting your career as a designer or front-end developer.
