> I worked at IBM for over 3 years and now I don't. Is the grass any greener on the other side? I realize now that grass is just grass and it's on me to make it greener. 

## First things first

Some gratitude is due: IBM was my first job as a front-end developer. 
Out of all my peers from my coding bootcamp who found jobs, I was probably one of the last to get hired. I knew that I wanted to code for a living because it just felt awesome to solve problems, even better to make something that helped solve a problem for someone else. Everything else I had tried professionally felt like a deadend. Getting hired at IBM was a big deal for me and I'm very grateful that I got to do some good work there.

## Actively making my job better

I walked out and moved teams cuz I didn't want to work on anymore bullshit that wasn't going anywhere




notes: [Carbon Design System](http://carbondesignsystem.com/)

Maybe a better question is, why did I stick around for as long as I did?

I'll start by saying this: I felt like I was more able to quit because now I have a portfolio piece that I'm really proud to share.

I get to say, "Hey, I worked on [Carbon Design System](http://carbondesignsystem.com/) at IBM. It's an actual thing that exists and it's out there!".

Basically, I felt like I was lucky enough to be a part of something bigger than myself and

Not only is it being used as a standard design system within IBM but it's open source, it shows up on my GitHub, I get to keep working on it if I want as a contributor and the industry has definitely acknowledged that we did a pretty good job with what we built.

I tend to fall into the trap of believing "the grass is always greener on the other side". I felt this way about work for a long time but at IBM, there was a lot happening around me that convinced me that it wasn't an ideal place for starting your career as a designer or front-end developer.
